# Automation of Target Public Distributed Systems

A website with React, Node and MySQL to manage fair price shops. Users will be allotted ration cards based on their income range and a FPS based on their location. For simplicity, every city is assumed to contain a fair price shop. Users will be allocated food and provisions based on their card for the month and can access/buy these via the online shop. The users will be able to look at trends regarding their purchases. The administrator gets reports regarding the gender, city, state distributions of the buyers with trends on time of purchase for better decisions. DBMS concepts as sequences, normalization, views have been experimented on this project.
